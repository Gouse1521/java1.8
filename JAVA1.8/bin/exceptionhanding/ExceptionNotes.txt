Exception:Exception is an event that occur during the excecution of program and disturbs normal flow of exception.

Exception Handling:
Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, 
IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.

Advantage of Exception Handling:
The core advantage of exception handling is to maintain the normal flow of the application. 
An exception normally disrupts the normal flow of the application; that is why we need to handle exceptions.

Types of Java Exceptions:
There are mainly two types of exceptions: checked and unchecked. An error is considered as the unchecked exception. However, according to Oracle, there are three types of exceptions namely:

Checked Exception
Unchecked Exception
Error


1) Checked Exception
The classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions. 
For example, IOException, SQLException, etc. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.

2) Unchecked Exception
The classes that inherit the RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions. For example, ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, etc. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, but they are checked at runtime.

3) Error
Error is irrecoverable. Some example of errors are OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError, AssertionError etc.


Java Exception Keywords:
Java provides five keywords that are used to handle the exception. The following table describes each.

Keyword	Description
try	The "try" keyword is used to specify a block where we should place an exception code. 
It means we can't use try block alone. The try block must be followed by either catch or finally.

catch	The "catch" block is used to handle the exception. 
It must be preceded by try block which means we can't use catch block alone. 
It can be followed by finally block later.

finally	The "finally" block is used to execute the necessary code of the program. 
It is executed whether an exception is handled or not.
throw	The "throw" keyword is used to throw an exception.
throws	The "throws" keyword is used to declare exceptions.
 It specifies that there may occur an exception in the method.
  It doesn't throw an exception. It is always used with method signature.
  
  
  
  java Exception Propagation
An exception is first thrown from the top of the stack and if it is not caught, it drops down the call stack to the previous method. If not caught there, the exception again drops down to the previous method, and so on until they are caught or until they reach the very bottom of the call stack. This is called exception propagation.

Note: By default Unchecked Exceptions are forwarded in calling chain (propagated).

Note: By default, Checked Exceptions are not forwarded in calling chain (propagated).
